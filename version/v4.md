# Version 4
## V4
> like v2 but longer enable amp

```py
TARGET_SIZE = 512  # Higher resolution for better segmentation
BATCH_SIZE = 16     # Smaller batch size for higher resolution
NUM_EPOCHS = 30    # More epochs for better convergence
LEARNING_RATE = 3e-4
WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-5  # L2 regularization
USE_AMP = True     # Use mixed precision for faster training
