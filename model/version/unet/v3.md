# Version 3
## V3
> Mainly testing old shrinking idea (this leads to much lower performance)

```py
TARGET_SIZE = 512  # Higher resolution for better segmentation
BATCH_SIZE = 4     # Smaller batch size for higher resolution
NUM_EPOCHS = 30    # More epochs for better convergence
LEARNING_RATE = 3e-4
WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-5  # L2 regularization
USE_AMP = False     # Use mixed precision for faster training


SHRINK_MASKS = True  # Whether to apply mask shrinking
SHRINK_KERNEL_SIZE = 5  # Size of the kernel for erosion (larger = more shrinking)
SHRINK_ITERATIONS = 1  # Number of iterations for erosion

## V3.1
> Longer training and higher learning rate

```py
TARGET_SIZE = 512  # Higher resolution for better segmentation
BATCH_SIZE = 4     # Smaller batch size for higher resolution
NUM_EPOCHS = 40    # More epochs for better convergence
LEARNING_RATE = 5e-4
WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-5  # L2 regularization
USE_AMP = False     # Use mixed precision for faster training


SHRINK_MASKS = True  # Whether to apply mask shrinking
SHRINK_KERNEL_SIZE = 2  # Size of the kernel for erosion (larger = more shrinking)
SHRINK_ITERATIONS = 1  # Number of iterations for erosion
```
