```py
TARGET_SIZE = 512  # Higher resolution for better segmentation
BATCH_SIZE = 4     # Smaller batch size for higher resolution
NUM_EPOCHS = 40    # More epochs for better convergence
LEARNING_RATE = 5e-4
WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-5  # L2 regularization
USE_AMP = False     # Use mixed precision for faster training

# Loss function configuration
BCE_WEIGHT = 0.7   # Weight for BCE loss (vs Dice loss)
USE_OUTLINE_LOSS = True  # Use outline-aware loss
OUTLINE_WEIGHT = 5.0  # Weight multiplier for outline regions

# Scheduler configuration
SCHEDULER_T0 = 5       # Restart every T0 epochs
SCHEDULER_MULT = 1     # T0 multiplier after each restart
SCHEDULER_MIN_LR = 1e-6  # Minimum learning rate

# Mask processing configuration
SHRINK_MASKS = True  # Whether to apply mask shrinking
SEGMENT_GAP_SIZE = 2  # Gap size between color segments (larger = wider gaps)
